# autoclicker.py
In this modified version, the pause variable and associated functionality have been removed, instead adding a clicking variable to control whether the autoclicker is active or not. Start and stop the clicking action using the F1 and F2 keys, respectively. The autoclicker will only click while the clicking variable is set to True.
